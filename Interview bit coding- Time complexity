Ques-1:      A) for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
 
             B) for(i = 0; i < n; i += 2)
 
             C) for(i = 1; i < n; i *= 2)
 
             D) for(i = n; i > -1; i /= 2)   
             
             Which function is the most efficient? In other words, which loop completes the fastest.

Solution:-
            A) for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
                Time complexity = O(n) 
                The loop variables is incremented / decremented by a constant amount
            B) for(i = 0; i < n; i += 2)
                Time complexity = O(n) 
                The loop variables is incremented / decremented by a constant amount
            C) for(i = 1; i < n; i *= 2)
                Time complexity = O(log n)
                The loop variables is divided / multiplied by a constant amount.
            D) for(i = n; i > -1; i /= 2)  
                The loop doesn't terminate. 
                
Ques-2:
            What is the time complexity of the following code :
            
            int a = 0, i = N;
            while (i > 0) {
              a += i;
              i /= 2;
          }
          
 Solution:-   a += i;
              i /= 2;
              The loop variable is added and divided by constant amount. Therefore, the time complexity = O(n) + O(log n)
              Overall, O(log n)
 
              Time complexities for while loop
              
              1) Time complexity of a simple loop when the loop variable is incremented or decremented by a constant amount:
                int i = 1;  
                do  
                  {  
                      i++;  
                  }while(i<=n);  
                                
                                O(n)
                                
                2)Time complexity of a loop when the loop variable is divided or multiplied by a constant amount:
                int i=1;  
                do  
                {  
                  i = i*c;  
                 }while(i<=n);   
                                O(log n)
                                
                 3)Time complexity of a nested loop.
                 int i=0;  
                do{  
                      do{  
                               int j =0;  
                                    j++;  
                           }while(j<=i);  
                       i++;  
                      }while(i<=n-1);   
                              
                              O(n^2)
